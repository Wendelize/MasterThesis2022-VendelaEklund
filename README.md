# MasterThesis2022-VendelaEklund
Master thesis project, consisting of procedurally generated impossible spaces in VR.

REQUIREMENT:
* Oculus/Meta Quest hardware

HOW TO:
{Sorry will fix this part in the future.}

The project goal is to maximize the usage of the playspace available when playing with VR. 
It takes the guardian as an input and the output is a overlapping maze architecture, where 
the amount of chunks/maps layered on top of each-other are connected through portals.
